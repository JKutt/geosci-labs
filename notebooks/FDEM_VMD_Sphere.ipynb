    "# Purpose and background theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we show fields and fluxes that result from placing a transient vertical magnetic dipole (VMD) source over an Earth model containing a spherical structure and an overburden layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are [two commonly used models](https://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell1_fundamentals/dipole_sources_in_homogeneous_media/magnetic_dipole_definition/index.html) for describing a harmonic VMD source: 1) as an infinitessimally small bar magnet that experiences a harmonic magnetization in the vertical direction, and 2) as an infinitessimally small horizontal loop of wire carrying a harmonic current. In either case, the harmonic VMD creates a primary harmonic magnetic field in its viscinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For geophysical applications, we use small current loops to approximate harmonic VMD sources. These EM sources may be placed on the Earth's surface or flown through the air (airborne surveys). Because the source's primary field is harmonic, it induces anomalous currents in the Earth. The distribution and strength of the induced currents depends on the frequency of the harmonic VMD source and the subsurface conductivity distribution. The induced current ultimately produce secondary magnetic fields which can be measured by a receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this app, we explore the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does the frequency impact the fields and currents produced by the harmonic VMD source?\n",
    "- For our geological model, how does changing the dimensions and conductivity of the layer and sphere impact the fields and currents produced by the harmonic VMD source?\n",
    "- How does the frequency impact secondary fields measured above the Earth's surface?\n",
    "- For our geological model, how does changing the dimensions and conductivity of the layer and sphere impact secondary fields measured above the Earth's surface?"

    "# Set up\n",
    "\n",
    "The geological scenario being modeled is shown in the figure below. Here, the Earth is comprised of a spherical structure and overburden layer within a homogeneous background. Each of the three geological units has its own conductivity ($\\sigma$). However, a constant magnetic susceptibility ($\\chi$) is used for units; where $\\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space and $\\mu = \\mu_0 (1 +\\chi)$. The depth to the layer is given by $d_1$ and $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a harmonic VMD source (*Tx*) is used to excite the Earth, and the vertical component of the Earth's EM response (secondary magnetic field) is measured by a receiver (*Rx*). In practice, the transmitter and receiver may be placed near the Earth's surface or in the air. The source may also operate at a variety of frequencies. Because we are operating in the frequency domain, fields and currents within the region may have both real and imaginary components.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the fields and currents resulting from a harmonic VMD source over a layered Earth we have two apps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields app:** Models the fields and currents everywhere at a particular frequency\n",
    "- **Data app:** Models the secondary magnetic field observed at the receiver as a function of frequency\n",
