    "\n",
    "Harmonic Vertical Magnetic Dipole (VMD) is a magnetic source, which excites the earth with EM induction. Magnetic source is sort of an artifical concept, and a small enough circular loop can be an equivalent. Different from homogenous earth, we often assume the earth is layerd indicating each layer has different electrical properties. For instance, often Tx is deployed in the air (e.g. airborne EM and small-loop EM) having zero conductivity (i.e. no conduction currents). This drastic contrast of electrical properties changes reflection and refraction of EM waves effectively distorts EM fields in the earth. Here, by using an app, a) we understand how an inductive source (circular loop) excite the earth, b) explore the impact of conductivity constrast in layers to both EM fields in the earth, and also measured  data at a receiver location.

    "# Set up\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a frequency domain EM method, which injects sinusoidal current. For this system, EM field is complex-valued hence it has both real and imaginary parts, and depending upon the transmission frequency behavior of EM fields from the earth vary. Here, we assume structure of the earth is layered, and we limit our attention to four layeres. Below Figure shows our setup, and each layer can have different electrical conductivity. Susceptibility of the 0-th layer is fixed to zero (i.e. $\\mu=\\mu_0$), but susceptibility of 1-3 layers ($\\chi$) can vary. Note that among 1-3 layers susceptiblity values are same, effectively magenetic permeability, $\\mu = \\mu_0(1+\\chi)$ values are same as well. There are two apps provided: a) Fields app and b) Data app. \n",
