    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "By injecting half-duty cycle current (having on- and off-time) to a loop, we inductively excite the earth medium. Often only \"off-time\" data are considered as measured data. For computation of this transient EM field, a step-off current having infinite duration of on-time is assumed. Here by using step-off current, we excite conductive layered-earth medium, explore propagation of EM fields in the earth (e.g. smoke ring), and investigate how different types of measured EM responses at a receiver location changes upon varying layered conductivity structures.

    "# Set up\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a time domain airborne EM or small-loop EM survey, of which a horizontal current loop is deployed in the air having zero conductivity (i.e. no conduction currents). After the current is off, secondary currents will be induced in conductive earth medium, and propagate as like \"smoke-ring\" in time. Here, we assume structure of the earth is layered, and we limit our attention to four layeres. Below Figure shows our setup, and each layer can have different electrical conductivity. Susceptibility of whole domain is fixed to zero (i.e. $\\mu=\\mu_0$). There are two apps provided: a) Fields app and b) Data app. \n",

    "- Q1: Run below Field app, and change \"Update\" to \"False\" to explore computed EM fields. Then move the slider bar for \"Time\" to see propagation of induced electric field in time (smoke ring). Describe the propagation of electric field in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q2: Now we want to recognize how this EM propagation in half-space earth was different from that in homogeneous earth, so set $\\sigma_0$ to 0.01 S/m (making $\\sigma_0=\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2=\\sigma_3$ = 0.01 S/m). Note that you should make \"Update\" to \"True\" to update computed EM fields upon your changes, then make it \"False\" to explore. Observe propagation of $E_y$ field in time, what is the main difference? and why that is happening?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q3: Back to the default half-space model, then similarly set \"Update\" to \"False\". Rotating electrical field is generated by time-varying magnetic flux, so let's see how dB/dt field propagate in time. Set \"Field\" to \"dBdt\", and \"AmpDir\" to \"Direction\". Move \"Time index\" slide bar, and observe how dB/dt propagate in time; while moving \"Time index\" go back and force to $E_y$ field. Note that you should change \"AmpDir\" to \"None\" to see $E_y$ field. Can you understand how dB/dt generates rotating electric field? (Faraday's Law)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q4: With the same setup, just change \"Field\" to \"J\" to see $J_y$, what is the difference between $E_y$ and $J_y$? Why this difference is occured?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q5: With the current density, magnetic flux density can be computed using Biot-Savart law. Go back and forth between $E_y$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ while you are moving \"Time index\". Do you understand how magnetic flux can be generated from currents? (Ampere's Law)"
